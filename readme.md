# cPanel 2012 Theme #

**cPanel 2012** is a brand new theme for cPanel by Zero Signal Productions. I felt that there was a lack of themes, especially good themes, for cPanel so I decided to make my own.

Since cPanel is full of disjointed code and pretty much follows no rhyme or reason for anything it wasn't the easiest to try and organize everything.

## Full control over cPanel CSS##

What I did do is take out this obnoxious file called **combined_optimized.css** that was hidden away and uneditable and instead reorganized all of the existing CSS and combined it into an easily accessible file called **local.css**.

## How to Install ##

Installing **cPanel 2012** is simple. If you're a reseller or root cPanel user simply log in to your main account and go to **Branding Editor > Create or Upload Branding**. From there you simply upload the **zero_signal.cpbranding.tar.gz** file.
